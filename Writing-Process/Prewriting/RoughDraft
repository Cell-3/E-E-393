The effects of 3D printing on manufacturing 

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), refers to various processes used to synthesize a three-dimensional object. It becomes “a revolutionary emerging technology that could up-end the last two centuries of approaches to design and manufacturing with profound geopolitical, economics, social, demographic, environmental, and security implications” (Campbell et al. 1). 
 
By applying this new technology, industries reduce the time of producing small batches drastically. However, manufacturing suffers some consequences at the same time. For instance, the localization propertity of 3D printing let people easily produce the products on demands with low costs at home rather than buying them from markets. Consequently, the country like China which highly depends on commercial export will lose a crucial tunnel of making money due to the reduce of demands. So, concerning the positive and negative effects that this new technology brings to manufacturing, helps people understand and judge the feasibility of extensively applying 3D printing on manufacturing. 

Positive Effects:
•	Mode of Production 
The traditional manufacturing forms, such as assembly line, assemble and install spare parts separately. This is a “subtractive” process, which carves the raw materials to the desired shape (Ehrenberg 22). By contrast, 3D printing transforms digital information directly to create objects layer-by-layer (adding materials from bottom to top). This assists industries to reduce time of producing products and demand of labors, which means less labors can fininsh the work in less time. So that the efficiency of producing increases and cost of manpower decreases. 

•	Resources & Environment
Traditional manufacturing relies on tooling, machinery, computers, robots and manpower to produce objects subtractively and separately. In contrast, AM creates physical parts form bottom to top directly from a standardized digital file (Campbell et al. 5), which designs the product mroe streamlined, utilizes the materials sufficiently, reduces material scrap and releasingly harmful chemicals, and cuts down the amount of energy usage. Additionally, most of the materials that are used to produce objects by 3D printing are recyclable. 
 
•	Science & Inventions
Since 3D printing is “producing a finished product, part or tool straight from a computer design” (Reis 16), it is able to create complex shapes that can not be produced by any other means.  Such a huge advantage offers scientists and engineers even greater design flexibility. In fact, a researcher at a Delaware hospital created a durable ABS-plastic exoskeleton customized to perfectly fit one child, Emma, allowing her to play, explore and hug for the first time (Reis 2). Therefore, 3D printing is changing the way doctors design prosthetics and it is also prodding engineers, architects and designers to think differently about the construction and function of car parts, airplanes and even whole buildings (Ehrenberg 22).

Negative Effects:
•	Economy 
Because of high efficiency and less manpower demands of 3D printing, it has potential to become the mainstream of manufacturing in the future. Consequently, the unemployment rate grows because workers, such as those working on assembling lines, will lose their jobs； the crime rate increase because some of the unemployed people may use illegal methods to make money for living. Morever, In addition, the profits for the countries like China, Japan and Thailand from commercial export will be cut down, with the soaring rates of localization of this technology.

•	Weapons Manufacturing
As AM becomes more and more matured, customized and low-cost, weapons manufacturers and terrorists have more opportunities of producing large amount of weapons. What’s worse, they can even design and create more lethal weapons and disguise them easily by applying 3D printing (Campbell et al. 13). Besides, such innovations could make life easier for illicit drug manufacturers as well (Ehrenberg 24). They can produce large amount of illicit drug with lost cost in a short time, which gives them far more profits. 


Overall, 3D printing is a distinctive AM process. The proliferation of 3D printing has consequences that go beyond shifts in manufacturing and supply chains (Ehrenberg 24). It dramatically increases the efficiency and reduces the waste materials of producing by making the whole producing process automatic. Also with its strong ability of building the complex shapes, scientists and engineers have much more opportunities of creating. However, there is no denying that AM brings some negative effects. The expansion of AM will lead to a growth of unemployment rate. Moreover, 3D printing makes it a lot simpler to “create makeshift weapons and produce counterfeit drugs”(Ehrenberg 24). Therefor, applying 3D printing is a trade-off issue for manufacturing. However, with the improvement of this technology, 3D printing will potentially become a transformative technology and dominant the future manufacturing.
