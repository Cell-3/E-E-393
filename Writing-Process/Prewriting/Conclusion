Conclusion

As the raw materials can be chosen greener and more recyclable, 3D printing reduces the possibilities of producing pollution and waste from initial step of manufacturing process. Meanwhile, during the whole process, its unique producing mode makes it possible to be more resource saving and environment friendly. The usefulness of 3D printing is improving all the time, although, the limitations of this cutting-edge technology still remains currently (e.g. the limited material choses, products sizes, etc.ï¼‰ Therefore, 3D printing will have a more positive impact on the environmental footprint of manufacturing in the future.
